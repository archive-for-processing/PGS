# Changelog

All notable changes to PGS will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Dates are *YYYY-MM-DD*.

## **1.1.2** *(2021-08-10)*
### Added
- `polygonizeLines()` to `PGS_Processing`. Computes the polygonal faces formed by a set of intersecting line segments.
- Additional method signature for `PGS_Processing.generateRandomGridPoints()` that accepts a random seed.
- `fieldWarp()` to `PGS_Morphology`. Warps a shape by displacing vertices according to a 2D noise vector field.
- `radialWarp()` to `PGS_Morphology`. Warps a shape by displacing vertices along a line between each vertex and the shape centroid.
- Expand PGS_Conversion to support conversion between:
  - `TRIANGLES` PShape➜JTS `MultiPolygon`
  - `QUADS` PShape➜JTS `MultiPolygon`

### Fixed
- Issue with negative rotation values in `PGS_Transformation.rotateAroundCenter()`.

## **1.1.1** *(2021-07-28)*
### Added
- `voronoiCells()` to `PGS_Voronoi`. Generates Voronoi diagrams from shapes or point sets, outputting the diagram as polygonal cells (rather than lines only, as before).
- Additional method signature for `voronoiDiagram()` that accepts a list of points (rather than PShapes only, as before).
- `findContainedPoints()` to `PGS_ShapePredicates`. Tests each point in a given point set whether it is contained in a shape, returning only those points that are contained.

### Changed 
- Constrained Voronoi diagrams are now constrained to envelope of input shape, rather than a arbitrarily large area.
- Refactored `List<PVector>` method arguments to `Collection<PVector>` where possible.

### Fixed
- `generateRandomPoints()` no longer skips over small subsections of shapes when generating random points.

## **1.1.0** *(2021-06-13)*

### Added
- **`PGS_CirclePacking`** — a class for circle packings of shapes, subject to varying constraints and patterns of tangencies
- `closestPointPair()` to `PGS_Optimisation`. Efficiently computes the **closest** pair of points in a set of points.
- `farthestPointPair()` to `PGS_Optimisation`. Efficiently computes the **farthest** pair of points in a set of points.
- `chaikinCut()` to `PGS_Morphology`. Smoothes shapes via iterated corner cuts.
- `createHeart()` to `PGS_Construction`. Generates heart-shaped PShapes.
- `urquhartFaces()` to `PGS_Triangulation`. Tessellates a triangulation into polygons corresponding to the faces of an _Urquhart graph_.
- `gabrielFaces()` to `PGS_Triangulation`. Tessellates a triangulation into polygons corresponding to the faces of an _Gabriel graph_. 
- Additional method signature for `earCutTriangulation()` accepts a PShape argument (previously it accepted a list of points only)
- Additional method signature for `generateRandomPoints()` that accepts a random seed.
- Additional method signature for each of the existing 3 *Delaunay Triangulation* methods, accepting a collection of points only.
- Expand `PGS_Conversion` to support conversion between:
  - `PATH` PShape⟷JTS `LineString`
  - `POINTS` PShape⟷JTS `MultiPoint`
  - `LINES` PShape⟷JTS `MultiLineString`

### Changed 
- Split `PGS_Processing.concaveHull()` into `concaveHullDFS()` and `concaveHullBFS()` (the method previously used the BFS approach only).
- Compute (rather than ignore) circle sites of radius 0 (these are effectively points) in `PGS_Voronoi.voronoiCirclesDiagram()`
- Replaced the algorithm used by `PGS_Processing.generateRandomPoints()` with a triangulation-based approach. The new approach is ~10x faster!
- Renamed `delaunayTriangulationTin()` to `delaunayTriangulationMesh()`.
- Renamed `poissonTriangulation()` to `poissonTriangulationPoints()` (the method of the same original name now outputs a PShape). 

### Fixed
- Error when `concaveHull2()` was called with alpha > 1.
- Concave hull methods no longer mutate the input point set.
- PShapes marked as closed and having less than 3 vertices could cause an error during conversion ([#22](https://github.com/micycle1/PGS/issues/22)).
- `PGS_Conversion.toPVector()` now handles [primitive](https://processing.org/examples/shapeprimitives.html) PShapes
- Constrained Delaunay triangulations now respect shape holes

### Removed
- `PGS_Processing.concaveHull()` (see *Changed*)
